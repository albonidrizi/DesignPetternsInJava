# DesignPetternsInJava
This project was created to serve as a teaching resource for students, providing clear and practical examples of **Java Structural Design Patterns**. These patterns are essential for organizing and structuring relationships between classes and objects, ensuring flexibility, maintainability, and better architecture in complex systems.


### Overview
Structural Design Patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger, more efficient structures. They help developers manage complexity by promoting reusable solutions to recurring design problems.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Demonstrate the practical application of Structural Design Patterns in Java.
- Highlight the benefits of these patterns in creating scalable and maintainable software.
- Provide a hands-on learning experience through real-world examples.

### Patterns Covered  
This project includes examples of the following Structural Design Patterns:  
1. **Adapter Pattern**: Enables incompatible interfaces to work together.  
2. **Bridge Pattern**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.  
3. **Composite Pattern**: Handles hierarchies of objects uniformly, allowing individual objects and composites to be treated in the same way.  
4. **Decorator Pattern**: Dynamically adds functionality to an object without altering its structure.  
5. **Facade Pattern**: Simplifies interactions by providing a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.  
6. **Flyweight Pattern**: Optimizes memory usage by sharing objects that are expensive to create when they have common properties.  
7. **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a placeholder or intermediary for controlling access to an object.  


### How to Use
- Explore the code examples for each pattern in the corresponding folders.
- Follow the detailed comments in the code to understand the implementation.
- Experiment with the code to see how the patterns function in different scenarios.

### Learning Objectives
By studying this project, students will:
- Gain a deep understanding of Structural Design Patterns.
- Learn how to apply these patterns to solve real-world software design challenges.
- Build a solid foundation in designing scalable and efficient Java applications.
